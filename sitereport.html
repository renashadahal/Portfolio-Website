            <p>This website utilises HTML and CSS to craft an appealing and functional portfolio for my work. The use of a soft and feminine colour palette with pink shades reflects my personality and gives off a friendly atmosphere. The use of the font ‘Poiret One” helps with the modern yet soft appearance of the website.</p>
            <p>The header bar has a navigation tool that contains links to all the webpages of the website, making it easily accessible to the user. A logo on the top left corner of the header bar establishes the company and gives the website a professional look. On the home page, a profile picture creates a personal connection, expressing that the company is driven by a young, passionate, and determined web designer. The profile picture is displayed in a round shape to make the website feel soft and inviting. The use of a “Learn More” button that is linked to the Contact page helps users navigate to the appropriate page for further information. The “Download CV” button is linked to a pdf of a CV (faux CV for now) that makes it easier for future clients and employers to download my CV.</p>
            <p>The “Contact Me” page features a header with my logo and a navigation menu. The main content includes a form where users can input their name, email address, phone number, and a message. The form is styled using an external CSS file and includes placeholder text for each input field. A submit button is provided at the bottom for users to submit their information. The page is designed to be simple and functional, facilitating user interaction and contact with the website's administrators or owners.</p>
            <p>The “Projects” page contains a gallery of previous projects (currently displaying stock images). It displays 8 pictures and has media queries so the rows and columns differ according to the device size.</p>
            <p>The “Video Demo” page directly links the user to the video demo uploaded in Kaltura Capture. It is quick, convenient and is made with the ease of the user in mind.</p>
